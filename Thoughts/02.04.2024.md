# Today I wrote something 
```
Every day is going as it is, like yesterday.
Lord, make my way; I walk on it
with His strength, and He gives
new experiences to learn from,
and also makes me learn new things
and grow. His grace makes me live.
Thank you, Lord, for making my way.

You give pain
in my life, to grow.
Sometimes I fail you,
but your love never
fails me.

Sometimes unexpected things
happen in my life; it
seems painful at that moment,
but they bring great things in
my life.

I only believe in you, O Lord!
You are my hope. Believing in
our own heart or any human
makes me fail and hurt and brings
me to trust only in you.

O Lord,
all things in the world are vanity like Solomon said,
but in the end, I decide. My purpose is to focus on the
eternal life you prepared for me.
But I thank you, Lord, for giving me
your wisdom to move on in this
world towards my purpose.
