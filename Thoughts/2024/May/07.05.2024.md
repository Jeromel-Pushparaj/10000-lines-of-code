# Todays thoughts

## Todays word of God and thoughts about it
- today I read one chapter from proverbs alone

## Today's God way and it's learning experience
- lord lord my day very well.
- today lord give me the oppurtunity to work with my sir ksevenraja
- and also today god's way is great and I trust in the lord


## What I learn 
**From Books**
```
I haven't tell you I think I started reading one thriller fiction book I read 28 pages tody from it I think
one good think about the fiction book is it was sometimes page turner sometime feels like sleepy but once you enter into the 
real story line it was un putdownable. I like the thriller genre in the fiction world I don't know why.
I always praise god and thank him for this habit to understand and gain knowledge about the world.
