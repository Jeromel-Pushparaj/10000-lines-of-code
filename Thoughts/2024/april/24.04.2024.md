# Todays thoughts

## Todays word of God and thoughts about it
- I read one chapter from job, psalm and proverbs
> Todays verse: Know that wisdom is such to your soul: if you find it , htere will be a future, and your hope will not be cut off.| do not
> rejoice when your enemy falls, and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles, lest the lord see it and be displeased. and turn away his anger from him. PROV : 24: 14, 17, 18
