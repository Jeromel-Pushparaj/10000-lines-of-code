- but god teach the lesson you need learn how to be in this situations too
- thank lord for teaching forgave I am sinner


## What I learn 
**From Books**
```
1. I started to read a book called humility by andrew murray
> here is the line which made me think: Humility is not a thing we bring to God. It is also not a thing God gives to us.
> It is simply the realization of what nothing we really are. when we truly see how God is Everything, and when we clear out room in our hearts so that he can be everything for us.
2. I started to read a book called The Intelligent investor by benjamin gragam I need to start to take notes too
```
**Career side**
```

after I got my net I am working on it. it take lot of time to run because I am using my pc cpu alone
```
