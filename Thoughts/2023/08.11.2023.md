After a long time I sit into code today morning. IN my college c contest was conduct I also participated in that competition the main reason I participate is to check my ability in problem
solving, also I think as a god given opportunity. out of five problem I can't even solve the one problem **that time only I realize that the knowing language is not enough building logic for a given problem is the main thing in the problem solving in programming.** 

>Lord thank you for this coding time without you I am nothing
